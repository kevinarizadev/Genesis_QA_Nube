# Visual Studio Integration Overview

The Visual Studio (VS) Extensions enhance the experience in developing web applications with Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Core.

As their major advantage, the VS extensions handle the [creation of projects]({% slug gettingstarted_aspnetmvc6_aspnetmvc %}#configuration-Create).

The VS extensions for Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core are distributed with the Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core installer. They support Visual Studio 2015 and, as of the R1 2017 release, Visual Studio 2017. Both VS versions handle ASP.NET MVC 6 applications.

> **Important**

> Visual Studio Express editions are not supported.
